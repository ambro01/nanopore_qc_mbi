The function plotBaseProductionRate() shows the rate at which actual nucleotide bases are called changes over time. One would expect this to be closely related to the event rate (since each event should correspond to a base moving through the pore), however it is possible to envisage an scenario where events are recorded, but for some reason the base caller struggles to interpret them.
